# DengueAwareness
This is my 3rd SEM mini-project 
the project is about making users aware about dengue condition near them
Office part of the project will be with the hospitals treating dengue patients
The officer will input the details of patient like his/her name, address, and sector in which he/she lives
then the system will check that if there are any users of ours who lives in the sector in which the active patient 
lives if yes then emails will be sent to them to take precautions
